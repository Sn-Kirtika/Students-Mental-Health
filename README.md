<h1 style="font-weight:bold;">Student mental health : </br>Stress, factors and coping strategies</h1>

## 📋 Project Overview

This project explores the causes of stress among students and identifies coping strategies through large-scale data analysis. It combines Big Data tools and Machine Learning techniques to gain insights into mental health challenges in academic environments.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify correlations between stress factors, coping mechanisms, and mental stress levels.
- Discover clusters of students based on their stress profiles and coping strategies.
- Use data-driven methods to assist ESGI in addressing student mental health more effectively.

## 📂 Structure

- Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Workflow Summary

1. **Dataset Loading**  
   Datasets are stored in the `/dataset` folder and are loaded into dataframes.

2. **Preprocessing & Cleaning**  
   Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and filtering irrelevant data.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Visualization of stress levels by gender, academic pressure, financial issues, sleep habits, etc.

4. **Findings & Insights**  
   Summary of correlations between stress factors and personal habits or support systems.

4. **Machine Learning Modeling**  
   Identification of student clusters using K-Means clustering, followed by PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for dimensionality reduction and visualization of the clusters.
